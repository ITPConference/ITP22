          <p>ITP'22 is scheduled for August 7-10, 2022, is part of FLoC, and will be held at Haifa, Israel.</p>

          <p><b>FloC2022 will be a physical conference.</b>
             The FLoC organizing committee will make every possible effort to ensure everyone is able to attend in person.
             They are, however, very much aware that there might be members of the community who cannot travel to Israel.</p>

            <p>For more information check the <a href="https://floc2022.org/">FLoC website.</a></p>
